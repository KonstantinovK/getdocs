# getdocs
A simple python code sequence for getting data from documentation Web sites.

###Task:
My team is responsible for competitive analysis of the cloud service operators market, 
specifically for the analysis of platform functionality. Every day we should faced with 
lots of documentation and spend a lot of time to research it and get right information,
after few weeks I suggest to implement LLM for this task.

###Solution:
My stack was Python + Notebooklm by Google.
I create few py scripts which collect all html pages from Web site with tech documentation,
convert it from HTML to TXT and then merge it to one master file which we upload to Notebooklm 
for further work.

###Profit:
My team start to save more time, for other activities. 
Improvement quality of result.
Boss happiness.
